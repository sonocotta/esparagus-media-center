# Amped Esparagus – Knob and Rotary Shaft Errata

## Issue Summary
The knob supplied with **Amped Esparagus** has a **6 mm** inner diameter, while the rotary encoder actually uses a **4.75 mm** shaft.  
This happened because it is very hard to find an **angled-mount rotary encoder with a push button**, and the one I was able to source has an **untypical 4.75 mm** shaft.

---

## Details

- Finding a knob that fits a **4.75 mm** shaft properly is **close to impossible**.  
- Originally, a **small soft tube** was included to fill the gap between the shaft and knob.  
  Unfortunately, the tube turned out **too soft**, making the knob **feel wobbly**.

## Solution

I designed a **new 3D-printed adapter** that fits much better.  
- The **STL file** is attached.  
- It is printed in **PLA**.  
- The fit is firm, and the knob feels solid and stable.

## Recommendation

If you have a wobbly knob, please **print and replace** the old soft tube with the new adapter.  
All **future orders** will be **shipped with the new adapter already installed**.

## Future Plans

In the next hardware revision, the rotary encoder will be replaced with a **more common 6 mm shaft** version.  
This will require a **small auxiliary board**, which will be part of the updated design.
